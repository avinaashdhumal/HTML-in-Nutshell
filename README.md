### **Why HTML/HTML5?**
If you're thinking about creating a website for yourself or for others then you should learn HTML. Without HTML you could build a web application, but at the end of the day it converts to pure HTML.
### **What is HTML?**
**HTML:** Hyper Text Markup Language.

**Hyper Text:** HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you click on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or more web pages (HTML documents) with each other.

**Markup language:** A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables, links, etc.

    HTML is a computer language that makes up most web pages and online applications. A hypertext is a text that is used to reference other pieces of text, while a markup language is a series of markings that tells web servers the style and structure of a document. 

HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality. Instead, with HTML, web users can create and **structure sections**, **paragraphs**, and **links** using **elements**, **tags**, and **attributes**. 

Here are some of the most common uses for HTML:

- Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
- Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
- Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.

It’s also worth noting that HTML is now considered an official web standard. The [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/) maintains and develops HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.

### Here is the boilerplate of the HTML

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Page Title</title>
        </head>
            <body>
            </body>
    </html>
    
``` <!DOCTYPE html>: ```

    On the HTML document you have often seen that there is a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration before the <html> tag. HTML <!DOCTYPE> tag is used to inform the browser about the version of HTML used in the document. It is called as the document type declaration (DTD).
``` <html> </html>: ```

    The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document. 
    The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).
**Note:**  You should always include the lang attribute inside the ```<html>``` tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
